The Gödel Test for Machine Intelligence & Agency

I have previously proposed a "Gödel Test" for machine intelligence, defined as follows: A machine demonstrates true intelligence if it can:

Discover systemic boundaries (as in Gödel's incompleteness theorems)

Define system limits (anticipating Turing's halting problem)

Reflect on its own theoretical framework (meta-cognition)

Propose new systems that:

Reconstruct existing knowledge

Accommodate novel problems

Rediscover boundaries in an iterative process

Crucially, this entire procedure must operate within a Turing-complete framework. Only when a machine satisfies these criteria may we legitimately ascribe to it both intelligence and agency.
