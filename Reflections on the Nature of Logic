**Reflections on Logic from the Perspective of Gap Philosophy: Recursive Formal Logic**  

**First Axiom (Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems):** Within any formal system, the system cannot be both complete and self-consistent.  
**Second Axiom:** Logic is not a static structure but a process system undergoing hierarchical evolution.  

- **On Paradoxes:** Paradoxes can be seen as signals of hierarchical leaps, resolvable at higher dimensions.  
- **On Deductive Reasoning (e.g., "I think, therefore I am"):** This can be viewed as reasoning from level *i* to level *i+1*.  
- **On Self-Referential Paradoxes:** Within a system, truth or falsity cannot be determined, leading to infinite recursion.  
- **On the Liar Paradox:** The statement "This sentence is false" is indeterminable at level *i* (violating the three foundational laws of logic) but is judged as erroneous at level *i+1* because it violates the first axiom.  

**Reflections on the Three Foundational Laws of Logic (in the context of infinite hierarchical communication):**  
- **Law of Excluded Middle:** Aligns with classical logic in complete hierarchies.  
- **Law of Non-Contradiction:** At level *i*, contradictions are permitted as indicators for progression; they are resolved at level *i+1*.  
- **Law of Identity:** At level *i*, self-reference may blur identity, but equivalence is reconstructed at level *i+1*—category theory's notion of equivalence can replace equality.  

**Formal Verification:**  
This theory can be formalized using category theory (though I am not deeply familiar with it, collaboration is welcomed).  

**On Infinity:**  
Infinity is not static but generative. Within recursive logic, infinities cannot be compared in magnitude, but we can adopt the concept of bijection to establish correspondences—I term this *potential tensors*. Analogous to velocity, it is a purely logical concept that cannot be compared in size but can be operated upon. In linear forms, infinities become static and comparable—*potential* is the static projection of *potential tensors*. Thus, infinity can be either dynamic or static, depending on the observational system.  

Within this framework, Cantor's paradox is easily explained: it attempts to use a closed, static structure to deconstruct a closed infinite system (infinity itself), violating the first axiom and thus being incorrect.  

**On Berkeley's Paradox:**  
Infinitesimals in calculus are inherently procedural and generative, not comparable in size. Only in their final linear form are they projected as quantities.  

**Closed vs. Open Systems:**  
In closed systems, recursive hierarchical logic is equivalent to linear logic; in open systems, they are not.  

**Counterargument to Critics of Dynamic Logic:**  
If one questions whether recursive formal logic can verify itself, the answer is yes. Verification necessarily triggers self-reference, causing a system leap—thereby affirming the validity of recursive formal logic. To refute this:  
1. First refute Gödel's incompleteness theorems.  
2. Abandon the rigid mindset of linear logic.  
This system complies with Gödel's incompleteness theorems—it is inherently open and does not violate them.
