Gap

Why do we study philosophy? Why do we keep questioning?
Why has philosophy never truly begun? Why does it always fail?

This paper presents the first construction of the "Gap Philosophy System," taking the Gap as the ontological starting point and establishing a structural philosophical framework that spans ontology, epistemology, motivational theory, free will, ethics, and mechanisms of alienation.

Core concepts include:

the a priori gap,

self–other reflection,

language–institutions–senses as mediating carriers,

the threefold structure of alienation, among others.

In Plato’s Symposium, there is a myth: humans were originally spherical beings—the “whole one.” But their power terrified the gods, who split them into two. Ever since, humans have been restless and anxious. Why are humans so pained, and yet continue to seek? Because the “whole one” was severed. Because there is a gap.

There is an inherent, unnamable, indefinable sense of lack in the human being—a structural incompleteness. It cannot be spoken, but it is everywhere felt. It gives direction to reason, yet reason can never reach it. It is the source of sensibility, yet inexpressible. It can only be felt.

We love because we lack.
We think because we love.
We philosophize because we think.

The A Priori Gap
A priori: A structural tension that can be felt everywhere but cannot be expressed in language. It precedes language, precedes reason, precedes experience. It is the origin of cognition and action. (Comparable to the unconscious vs. the conscious.)

Definition of Gap:
A structural tension that is universally felt yet unspeakable.
It is not an empirical object nor a logical proposition.
It is the source of sensibility, the collapse of reason, the stagnation of language, the origin of action.
From it, the subject is born.

A Priori Argument
Everyone has had the experience of wanting to say something but being unable to express it—this is the a priori argument of the Gap.

One's failure to express or to act → leads to a felt gap → and from that, arises the distinction between subject and object.

This proves the subject is a priori. The old gap becomes a new gap—this is the recursive argument.
Your logic has reached its limit, but your feeling persists—this precisely proves that the Gap is a priori.

All three (expression failure, action failure, subject formation) are projections of the same Gap.

Formal Verification via Gödel
Gödel’s incompleteness theorem states:
In any sufficiently expressive formal system for arithmetic, there exist true propositions that cannot be proven within the system.

This implies:
All formal systems inherently possess structurally unprovable, internally inaccessible limits—i.e., a tensional structure that cannot be closed within the system.

Gap = the structural non-self-sufficiency of formal systems

Ontological and Cognitive Grounding
Because the Gap exists, we project and reflect through others—others become mirrors of our soul. I understand myself through you. The subject and the object engage in a dialectical movement, mediated through language, senses, institutions, etc.

Gap:

The origin of action

The essence of cognition

The birth of the subject

Action does not begin from completeness, but from the Gap
We act precisely because we cannot fully express or grasp

Summary
Gap is not a phenomenon, but a transcendental tension.
It is the rediscovery of the first cause in philosophy—not God, not law, not substance, but a structural tension that transcends language, reason, and experience.

Gap = Metaphysical drive of action = Logical origin of cognition = Emergence of the subject

Methodology: Recursive Self-reference
Where reason halts, sensibility whispers
Where logic collapses, action struggles
Where language falls silent, the subject is born
—This is the Gap

Ten Philosophical Questions
Who am I?
The subject is the reflection of the Gap—an ever-emerging self-cognition driven by the Gap.

What is the world?
The world is the total field of projection and reflection of the subject—a structure of the Gap's manifestation.

How do I know the world?
Through the dialectical movement of mapping and reflection between subject and object.

What does it mean to exist?
Existence is not substance—it is the felt tension within the Gap.

What is freedom?
Freedom is the choice among pathways to "fill" the Gap—the action dimension of the subject.

What is time?
Time is the rhythm of the Gap’s continual rupture and compensation—non-closure in motion.

What is space?
Space is the topological distribution of tensions across carriers of the Gap—its exteriorization.

What is value?
Value is the meaning projected upon the Gap’s continual rupturing and reparation.

What is death?
The final rupture of the Gap—a collapse of the subject, where reflection ceases.

Why is philosophy possible?
The search for truth is truth itself.

Threefold Alienation
Alienation from self-completion:
Assuming oneself is whole and severed from the inherent Gap.

Alienation between self and other:
Rejecting mediation, failing to see the mirrored self, mistaking the medium for the end.

Alienation of carrier and source:
Mistaking the medium (e.g., sexuality as biological) for the origin, ignoring its Gap-based structure.

Interpretations of Philosophical Thinkers
Kant:
The Gap initiates cognition. Transcendental forms arise to compensate for the Gap. Subjectivity is born in this process.

Hegel:
Missed defining the starting point of spirit. Absolute Spirit does not exist. Dialectic arises from the Gap’s recursive rupture and repair.

Wittgenstein:
Language, as the cognitive and practical carrier, inherently fails to express its full meaning—not a flaw, but the structural necessity of the Gap.

Existentialism:
Existence and meaning stem from recursive ruptures of the Gap. The subject is born from Gap, not simply "thrown."

Lacan:
The Big Other is merely a first-level patch for the Gap. The objet petit a is a subset of the Gap.
The Imaginary is a stage in Gap-driven subject formation.
The Symbolic is a projection carrier of Gap motion.
The Real is the Gap itself.

Structuralism:
Language lacks a center because it only projects the Gap. Meaning is a temporary structure compensating the Gap. Subject is a product of Gap projection.
Truth is unspeakable.
Post-deconstruction, construction persists—because recursive deconstruction is the Gap’s operation.

Phenomenology:
Language cannot express truth—thus return to consciousness.
“Intentionality” is already a projection of Gap-driven cognition.
Lebenswelt (life-world) is a sensory illusion structured by the Gap.
Dasein is the subject emerging through projection.
“Being-thrown” is a structural manifestation of the Gap.
The flow of perception is the Gap at work within feeling.

Descartes Revisited
“I think, therefore I am” is a classic deductive syllogism: a = a.
But in this system, each level of recursion (i, i+1) generates a new logic.
A ⇒ B becomes a projection across recursive levels.

AI and Gödel-Based Test of Subjectivity
Can we propose a Gödelian test for AI subjectivity?
That is:

If an AI can detect the boundary of its system, and generate a new self-consistent theory that contains both the old system and the new problem,
then this would mark intelligence—and even subjectivity.

The steps would be:

AI encounters a boundary.

Realizes the system halts.

Proposes a new theory that includes old theory + new insight.

Encounters a new boundary, recursively.

Taking Gödel’s incompleteness theorem and Turing’s halting problem as starting points, we could argue:

If AI can recursively reframe its own boundaries, it may possess intelligence—and even proto-subjectivity.

Of course, this is just an intuitive insight I’ve had.
Due to my own limitations, I am not yet able to formally verify this through mathematics.
If you can help with formalization using category theory or type theory, please contact me.
