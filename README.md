# gap
Symposium by Plato tells a story: in the beginning, humans were spherical beings — the whole ones. But their power was too great, and the gods feared them. So the gods split the whole ones into two. Ever since, humans have lived in anxiety and longing. I think: why is human life filled with suffering, yet we still persist in seeking? Because there is something like that original cleft, the absence left from being split apart.

Ontology — The Gap:
Human beings are inherently incomplete. There is an unspeakable, indefinable instinct to pursue self-completion. It cannot be articulated, yet it is felt everywhere. It offers direction to reason, yet reason can never truly reach it — for the boundaries of language are the boundaries of thought. It is the source of sensibility, but cannot itself be spoken. It can only be sensed.

Epistemology — Failed Projection:
All acts of consciousness are attempts to project, to complete, to fail, and to project again — a chain of mediations.

Drive Theory — The Infinite Return:
Because of the gap, we seek to mend it. But wholeness is forever out of reach. So we repeat — endlessly.

Ethics — The Meaning of the Gap:
Once we understand that our actions stem from the urge to complete ourselves, we must act even more courageously. For the gap is both the end and the beginning. It gives meaning to becoming. We must keep striving for self-completion — this is the meaning of the gap.

Free Will — Freedom as Path-Choice:
Free will lies in choosing the path of how we attempt to mend the gap.

Threefold Alienation:

Alienation from Self-Completion:
Believing oneself already complete — cutting oneself off from the gap — is the first alienation.
Alienation Between Self and Other:
Rejecting the medium of reflection, failing to see oneself in the Other, treating the intermediary as the end. Mistaking the subject for the self — this is alienation.
Alienation of Medium and Essence:
When the vehicle is mistaken for the origin — for example, when sex (a biological medium of reflection) is mistaken for essence — alienation occurs.
Alienation deepens itself: one kind leads to another. It escalates in degree until the self collapses entirely.

On Love —
Love is a concrete manifestation of the gap. When love is alienated, it becomes the deepest betrayal of the essence of the gap. Those who err in love are not necessarily wrong — they are often the most sensitive souls, who simply took a wrong first step. But they keep walking until they forget the way home, and in doing so, disintegrate.
The Wall of Rationality
We must contemplate what is a priori; both the gap and the self are a priori. We cannot provide a complete definition through logic, yet we can perceive them everywhere. When you ask which is the first principle, we must admit that we do not know, because logic cannot reach it. We cannot use the tool of a mirror’s reflection to confirm seeing the mirror itself. Therefore, regarding the question of which comes first — autonomous consciousness or the gap — we do not know, and we ought to remain silent about what cannot be spoken
This paper presents the first construction of the "Gap Philosophy System," taking the Gap as the ontological starting point and establishing a structural philosophical framework that spans ontology, epistemology, motivational theory, free will, ethics, and mechanisms of alienation. Core concepts include: the a priori gap, self–other reflection, language–institution–senses as mediating carriers, the threefold structure of alienation, and love as the manifestation of the gap.
