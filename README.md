# gap
Symposium by Plato tells a story: in the beginning, humans were spherical beings — the whole ones. But their power was too great, and the gods feared them. So the gods split the whole ones into two. Ever since, humans have lived in anxiety and longing. I think: why is human life filled with suffering, yet we still persist in seeking? Because there is something like that original cleft, the absence left from being split apart.

Ontology — The Gap:
Human beings are inherently incomplete. There is an unspeakable, indefinable instinct to pursue self-completion. It cannot be articulated, yet it is felt everywhere. It offers direction to reason, yet reason can never truly reach it — for the boundaries of language are the boundaries of thought. It is the source of sensibility, but cannot itself be spoken. It can only be sensed.

Epistemology — Failed Projection:
All acts of consciousness are attempts to project, to complete, to fail, and to project again — a chain of mediations.

Drive Theory — The Infinite Return:
Because of the gap, we seek to mend it. But wholeness is forever out of reach. So we repeat — endlessly.

Ethics — The Meaning of the Gap:
Once we understand that our actions stem from the urge to complete ourselves, we must act even more courageously. For the gap is both the end and the beginning. It gives meaning to becoming. We must keep striving for self-completion — this is the meaning of the gap.

Free Will — Freedom as Path-Choice:
Free will lies in choosing the path of how we attempt to mend the gap.

Threefold Alienation:

Alienation from Self-Completion:
Believing oneself already complete — cutting oneself off from the gap — is the first alienation.
Alienation Between Self and Other:
Rejecting the medium of reflection, failing to see oneself in the Other, treating the intermediary as the end. Mistaking the subject for the self — this is alienation.
Alienation of Medium and Essence:
When the vehicle is mistaken for the origin — for example, when sex (a biological medium of reflection) is mistaken for essence — alienation occurs.
Alienation deepens itself: one kind leads to another. It escalates in degree until the self collapses entirely.

On Love —
Love is a concrete manifestation of the gap. When love is alienated, it becomes the deepest betrayal of the essence of the gap. Those who err in love are not necessarily wrong — they are often the most sensitive souls, who simply took a wrong first step. But they keep walking until they forget the way home, and in doing so, disintegrate.
The Wall of Rationality
We must contemplate what is a priori; both the gap and the self are a priori. We cannot provide a complete definition through logic, yet we can perceive them everywhere. When you ask which is the first principle, we must admit that we do not know, because logic cannot reach it. We cannot use the tool of a mirror’s reflection to confirm seeing the mirror itself. Therefore, regarding the question of which comes first — autonomous consciousness or the gap — we do not know, and we ought to remain silent about what cannot be spoken
This paper presents the first construction of the "Gap Philosophy System," taking the Gap as the ontological starting point and establishing a structural philosophical framework that spans ontology, epistemology, motivational theory, free will, ethics, and mechanisms of alienation. Core concepts include: the a priori gap, self–other reflection, language–institution–senses as mediating carriers, the threefold structure of alienation, and love as the manifestation of the gap.

柏拉图会饮篇有一个故事，一开始人是一个圆球（the whole one），但是力量太强大，神非常害怕，于是神把the whole one劈开成了两个人，人们惶惶不可终日，我觉得人为何如此痛苦呢为什么痛苦还要去追寻呢，因为有个类似the whole one被割开有个缺口
人本身有一种追求自我完备的缺憾，这种本能无法言说，无法定义，但是可以处处感知。为理性指引方向，但理性却始终无法到达，因为语言的边界是思想的边界。是感性的源泉但是不可言说。只能去感受
正因为有裂口存在但是我们与他人进行映射与回映，即对方是我的灵魂镜像，我要通过你来认识我来完备我，主体与客体进行辩证运动，映射与回映的这个过程的映射载体就是语言，感官，制度等等。这个过程的映射载体回映映射与回映本身不断进行辨证运动。
本体论：缺口，人本身有一种追求自我完备的缺憾，这种本能无法言说，无法定义，但是可以处处感知。为理性指引方向，但理性却始终无法到达，因为语言的边界是思想的边界。是感性的源泉但是不可言说。只能去感受
认识论：一切意识行为都是试图投射补全失败再投射的中介。例如语言，逻辑，感官
动力论：我们因为有缺口要去补全缺口但是却终难以圆满于是不停往复
论伦理：当我们知道我们的活动来源于缺口的自我补完的时候我们更应该去行动，因为缺口是终点又是起点我们就应该不断自我补全这就是缺口的意义
论自由意志：自由意志是对于缺口补全补全路径的选择
论三重异化
1.	自我完备异化：认为自己是完备的与缺口本身相互割裂进行异化
2.	自我与他人异化；拒绝中介，无法看到自我被异化，把中介当作终点：把主体当作自身拒绝回映，被异化
3.	载体与本源异化：将载体与本源异化，比如性本质是映射的生物载体，错误的把性当作本源被异化
异化本身会导致进一步异化例如从一种逐渐发展成三种程度逐渐加深最后自我崩解
论爱情：爱本身就是缺口的一种具体表现，爱被异化本身就是对缺口本体最大的拒绝。他们并非有错而是太有灵性走错了第一步随后逐渐加深最后却忘了回家的路导致自我崩解
论理性之墙
我们必须思考什么先验的，gap，我，运动三者本身都是先验的我们无法用逻辑给出完整定义，但是可以处处感知。当你询问谁是第一性时候，我们必须我们不知道，因为逻辑无法到达。我们不能用镜子倒影的工具来确认看到镜子本身。所以自主意识和gap的先后问题我们并不知晓，而且我们对于无法言说的应当保持沉默
