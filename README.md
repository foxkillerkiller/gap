Gap Philosophy: Why Philosophy Has Never Begun and Why It Always Fails
Why do we study philosophy, and why do we keep questioning?
This paper presents the first construction of the "Gap Philosophy System," taking the Gap as the ontological starting point and establishing a structural philosophical framework that spans ontology, epistemology, motivational theory, free will, ethics, and mechanisms of alienation. Core concepts include: the a priori gap, self–other reflection, language–institution–senses as mediating carriers, and the threefold structure of alienation.

In Plato’s Symposium, there is a story: at first, humans were whole spheres (the whole one), but their power was so great that the gods were afraid. So the gods split the whole one into two halves. Humans became fearful and restless. I wonder why humans suffer so much and why, despite suffering, they still seek? Because the whole one was split apart—there is a gap. Humans have an instinctive, undefinable longing for self-completeness. This instinct cannot be put into words but can be perceived everywhere. It guides reason but reason can never fully reach it. It is the source of sensibility but cannot be expressed, only felt.

We love because of lack, think because of love, and philosophize because of thought.

A priori: A structural tension that can be perceived everywhere but cannot be spoken, prior to language, reason, and experience. It is the beginning of cognition and action (similar to the unconscious and conscious).

Definition of Gap: A structural tension that can be perceived everywhere but cannot be spoken; it is neither an object of experience nor a logical proposition. It is the source of sensibility, the collapse of reason, the stagnation of language, the origin of action, and the birth of the subject.

A priori argument: Everyone has feelings they want to express but cannot. This is the OKGAP a priori argument. People’s inability to express feelings and the failure of action (OK movement a priori) together distinguish subject and object. The subject’s a priori proof: the whole cycle of failure turns an old gap into a new gap. This circular argument reaches the limit of logic but feeling remains, which precisely shows the gap behind it is a priori. These three are all projections of the Gap.

Formal verification: Gödel’s incompleteness theorem states that in any axiomatic system sufficient to express natural number arithmetic, there exist propositions that cannot be proven true within the system itself. This means any formal system has boundary propositions that cannot be internally closed consistently; there is a structural tension that the system cannot express but nevertheless truly acts upon.

Because the gap exists, we engage in mutual mapping and reflection with others — others become the mirror of my soul, and I seek self-completion through you. The dialectic movement between subject and object, mapping and reflection, is mediated by language, senses, institutions, etc. This mediation undergoes continuous dialectical movement.

Thus,
gap = the incompleteness of formal systems.

Gap: A structural tension that can be perceived everywhere but cannot be spoken; not an object of experience nor a logical proposition. It is the source of sensibility, the collapse of reason, the stagnation of language, the origin of action, and the birth of the subject.

Through formal proof, we conclude:
gap = the essence of action.
The starting point of behavior is not completeness but the gap.
Because it cannot be expressed or mastered, we begin to act.

Gap = the essence of cognition.
Cognitive unfolding is the continuous projection and reflection of the gap.
All cognitive activities are successive failures but necessary self-completions.

Gap = the birth of subjectivity.
The subject is not preset but generated from places that cannot close.
The subject is the perceiver and actor responding to the gap.

Summary:
The gap is not a phenomenon but an a priori tension.
The gap is the rediscovery of the first mover in philosophy—not a god, not a law, not an entity, but a structural tension transcending language, reason, and experience.
Gap = the metaphysical driver of action = the logical starting point of cognition = the emergence of subjectivity.

Where reason halts, sensibility begins to whisper;
Where logic collapses, action struggles;
Where language falls silent, subjectivity quietly emerges;
This is the gap.

Ten Philosophical Questions
Who am I?
The subject is the reflection of the gap, an ever-generating self-cognitive activity within the gap.

What is the world?
The world is the total field of subject’s projection and reflection, the manifest structure of the gap.

How do I know the world?
Through the dialectic movement of mapping and reflection between subject and object.

What does existence mean?
Existence is not a substance but the tension felt within the gap.

What is freedom?
Freedom is the dimension of action where the subject chooses how to complete the gap.

What is time?
Time is the rhythm of continuous completion and cracking of the gap — the structural incompleteness in motion.

What is space?
Space is the distribution of tension among the multiple carriers of the gap — its topological unfolding, the externalization of the gap.

What is value?
Value is the meaningful projection onto the continuous completion and cracking of the gap — the generation of ethics under the gap.

What is death?
Death is the termination of the gap’s movement, the collapse of subjectivity when reflection fails.

Why is philosophy possible?
Seeking truth is truth itself.

On the Threefold Alienation
Self-completeness alienation: Believing oneself to be complete and thus alienated from the gap itself.

Self-other alienation: Rejecting mediation, unable to see self’s alienation, mistaking mediation for an end, rejecting reflection, and thus alienated.

Carrier-origin alienation: Alienating the carrier from the origin; e.g., confusing sexual biology (carrier) for essence (origin), thus alienated.

Views on the History of Philosophy
On Kant:
The gap initiates cognition, forming a priori forms that drive cognition to move to complete the gap. Subjectivity is born in this process, iterated multiple times to form understanding.

On Hegel:
Hegel failed to clarify the starting point of spirit’s movement. Under this view, the absolute spirit does not exist; the core dynamic of dialectics is the internal gap of an incomplete system, the repeated repair and rupture.

On Wittgenstein:
Language as a carrier of cognition and action can never fully carry its own meaning. The incapacity of language to fully carry its meaning is not a problem but a structural necessity of the gap.

On Existentialism:
Existence and meaning are recursive breaks at different levels of the gap. Humans are not abandoned subjects; subjectivity is born from the gap’s construction seeking primordial completion. Desire is the pursuit of original remedy; subjectivity is a construct of the gap, not innate.

On Lacan:
The “big Other” is merely the first systemic patch of the gap and cannot be described by language. Object a is essentially a subset of the gap. The Imaginary is the stage process of subjectivity born under gap’s drive. The Symbolic is a projection and carrier of the gap’s movement. The Real is the gap itself.

On Structuralism:
Language has no center; it is merely the projection carrier of the gap and cannot bear its essence. Meaning always drifts; meaning is a temporary path for gap compensation. The subject cannot unify; subjectivity arises precisely from the ununifiability of subject-object. Truth is unsayable; truth is the search for truth itself. After deconstruction, there is no construction, yet construction continues; this is the inevitability of the gap’s operation.

On Phenomenology:
Language cannot carry the truth of phenomena, so return to consciousness and experience themselves. “Intentionality” is essentially a cognitive tension mapping path generated by the gap’s structure; it is a projection. According to Kant, pure reason is absolute and universal. Under Gödel’s incompleteness, phenomenology is essentially a projection. Intentionality is the external projection path of gap cognition. The lifeworld is a sensory layer cognitive illusion constructed by the gap’s compensatory mechanism. Dasein is the structural manifestation of the gap. Being-thrown is the structural manifestation of the gap. The flow of perception is essentially the gap’s mapping on the sensory layer. Phenomena are transient stable images of the gap’s unclosed state.

On the Evolutionary Direction of GAP Philosophy: GAP Itself Is Not the Essence of Systems, but Evolution Is the Essence—GAP as Noise in Complex Systems

Key Expansions for Theoretical Refinement:

Complexity Science Integration

Frame GAP as directional noise within complex adaptive systems, where its role shifts from passive "flaws" to active evolutionary catalysts.

Reference Stuart Kauffman’s "Adjacent Possible": GAPs expand the phase space of system states, enabling emergent transitions.

Evolution as Primacy

Argue that evolution (dynamic adaptation) is fundamental, while GAPs are its operational units—akin to mutations in evolutionary algorithms.

Cite Prigogine’s dissipative structures: Systems far from equilibrium use noise (GAPs) to reorganize at higher complexity.

Quantifiable Emergence

Propose metrics for GAP-driven emergence:

Critical噪点密度: Threshold where GAPs trigger phase transitions (e.g., percolation theory).

Information cascades: How local GAPs propagate systemic change (via network science).

Mathematical Formalization

Model GAPs as Levy flights in state space: Rare, high-impact disruptions that power scaling laws.

Use category theory to map GAP hierarchies (e.g., micro-macro feedback loops).

Implications for AI/Consciousness:

Training protocols: Inject GAPs (e.g., randomized weight pruning) to force adaptive self-repair—potentially accelerating artificial agency.

Ethics of engineered collapse: If evolution requires GAPs, should societies institutionalize "controlled destabilization"?

Conclusion:
GAP philosophy’s next leap lies in operationalizing evolutionary noise—transforming it from metaphor to measurable mechanics. This bridges complexity theory, information physics, and post-Darwinian cognition.
