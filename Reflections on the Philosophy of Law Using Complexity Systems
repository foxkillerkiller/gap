Law as a Complex Adaptive System in Dynamic Balance Between Value Gravity, Rule Rigidity, and Social Disturbance
Research Question: How does law evolve?
Methodology: Complexity Science

Critique and Reflection on Different Schools of Legal Philosophy

Functional Co-optation

Operation: Transform each school into a system component

Natural law as an attractor

Legal positivism as a stabilizer

Critical legal studies as noise

Dynamic Contextualization

Operation: Situate each school within evolving system states

Example: Dworkin's "integrity" interpretation works during system steady states (stabilizer-dominant)

But fails during phase transitions (when noise overwhelms stabilizers, requiring emergent logic)

Parametric Transformation

Operation: Convert philosophical debates into adjustable parameters

"Law-morality relationship" → Attractor coupling coefficient γ∈[0,1]

"Judicial discretion" → Noise injection rate λ

II. Five-Dimensional Critique of Existing Theories

Static Fallacy

Critique: Traditional theories assume legal systems exist in equilibrium

Rebuttal:

Real-world law operates in metastable states

Phase transition theory proves Rawls' "original position" is merely a transient snapshot

Reductionist Limitation

Critique: Schools attempt to explain law through single principles (morality/rules/power)

Linear Trap

Target: Traditional linear causality models (e.g., "legislation → adjudication → compliance")

Critique:

Legal systems exhibit nonlinear feedback (e.g., #MeToo movement recursively strengthening gender legislation)

Normative-Descriptive Dichotomy

Problem: Perennial opposition between natural law (normative) and positivism (descriptive)

Solution:

Emergent ethics: Normative outcomes arise from descriptive processes

Example: System convergence toward attractors (descriptive) inherently satisfies justice demands (normative)

Crisis Explanation Failure
